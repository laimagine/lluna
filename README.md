# lluna
Lluna (by LA Imagine) is a phonegap/cordova based app to encrypt passwords. It takes simple keys such as MyYahooPasword, MmmCupCakes, RedSoxSedRox, etc., and converts them to complex passwords, which can be used anywhere and every where password are needed.

Lluna removes all the complications involved with creating, remembering, saving and retrieving passwords without having to deal with any of the hassles associated. In fact, Lluna takes a step further and does NOT store any of your information, neither the simple keys that you enter nor the passwords it generates.

Lluna has no such single point of failure.

On your phone, Lluna creates the same password for the same key every time. Lluna is not a random password creator as it generates the same password for the same key on the same device without storing any of your keys or passwords anywhere. If you enter a different key, Lluna creates different password. If someone else enters the same key on a different device, it creates a different password.
